## Simple CLI User Management System

A **lightweight Command-Line Interface (CLI)** application written in **Go** that manages users stored in a **PostgreSQL** database.  
It supports user creation, retrieval, updates, and deletions â€” all directly from the terminal.

This project demonstrates a clean, modular design for building database-driven Go applications.  
It includes:
- Repository pattern for clean data access
- Decorator pattern for internal modules and middleware 
- Middleware for logging and transactional handling
- Unit tests using [sqlmock](https://github.com/DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock)
- Docker setup for PostgreSQL

---

## Features

- CRUD operations for users  
- Transactional middleware for safe DB operations  
- Logging middleware to track queries  
- Fully testable SQL layer using mocks  
- Docker Compose integration for easy database setup
